Notes for translators
=====================

systemd depends on gettext for multilingual support.
In po/ directory you'll find the needed files.

POT (Portable Object Template)
------------------------------
A text file with .pot extension, with all the extracted labels from code.

To update the template:

$ cd systemd/
$ ninja -C build systemd-pot

To start a new translation:

$ cd po/
$ cp systemd.pot <YOUR-LANG-CODE>.po

Replace <YOUR-LANG-CODE> with the two-letters codes of ISO 639 standard.

PO (Portable Object)
--------------------
A text file with .po extension, with all the available labels and some additional
metadata fields. Any editor is ok, but a good standard is 'poedit', a graphical
application specifically designed for this kind of task.
