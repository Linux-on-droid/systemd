    <title>Description</title>

    <para><command>systemd-resolved</command> is a system service that provides network name resolution to local
    applications. It implements a caching and validating DNS/DNSSEC stub resolver, as well as an LLMNR resolver and
    responder. Local applications may submit network name resolution requests via three interfaces:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>The native, fully-featured API <command>systemd-resolved</command> exposes on the bus. See the
      <ulink url="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/resolved">API Documentation</ulink> for
      details. Usage of this API is generally recommended to clients as it is asynchronous and fully featured (for
      example, properly returns DNSSEC validation status and interface scope for addresses as necessary for supporting
      link-local networking).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>The glibc
      <citerefentry project='man-pages'><refentrytitle>getaddrinfo</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> API as defined
      by <ulink url="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3493">RFC3493</ulink> and its related resolver functions,
      including <citerefentry project='man-pages'><refentrytitle>gethostbyname</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>. This
      API is widely supported, including beyond the Linux platform. In its current form it does not expose DNSSEC
      validation status information however, and is synchronous only. This API is backed by the glibc Name Service
      Switch (<citerefentry project='man-pages'><refentrytitle>nss</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>). Usage of the
      glibc NSS module <citerefentry><refentrytitle>nss-resolve</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
      is required in order to allow glibc's NSS resolver functions to resolve host names via
      <command>systemd-resolved</command>.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Additionally, <command>systemd-resolved</command> provides a local DNS stub listener on IP
      address 127.0.0.53 on the local loopback interface. Programs issuing DNS requests directly, bypassing any local
      API may be directed to this stub, in order to connect them to <command>systemd-resolved</command>. Note however
      that it is strongly recommended that local programs use the glibc NSS or bus APIs instead (as described above),
      as various network resolution concepts (such as link-local addressing, or LLMNR Unicode domains) cannot be mapped
      to the unicast DNS protocol.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The DNS servers contacted are determined from the global settings in
    <filename>/etc/systemd/resolved.conf</filename>, the per-link static settings in
    <filename>/etc/systemd/network/*.network</filename> files, the per-link dynamic settings received over DHCP and any
    DNS server information made available by other system services. See
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>resolved.conf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry> and
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.network</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry> for details
    about systemd's own configuration files for DNS servers. To improve compatibility,
    <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> is read in order to discover configured system DNS servers, but only if it is
    not a symlink to <filename>/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf</filename> or
    <filename>/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf</filename> (see below).</para>

    <para><command>systemd-resolved</command> synthesizes DNS resource records (RRs) for the following cases:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>The local, configured hostname is resolved to
      all locally configured IP addresses ordered by their scope, or
      — if none are configured — the IPv4 address 127.0.0.2 (which
      is on the local loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is the
      local host).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>The hostnames <literal>localhost</literal> and
      <literal>localhost.localdomain</literal> (as well as any hostname
      ending in <literal>.localhost</literal> or <literal>.localhost.localdomain</literal>)
      are resolved to the IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>The hostname <literal>_gateway</literal> is
      resolved to all current default routing gateway addresses,
      ordered by their metric. This assigns a stable hostname to the
      current gateway, useful for referencing it independently of the
      current network configuration state.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>The mappings defined in <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> are resolved
      to their configured addresses and back, but they will not affect lookups for
      non-address types (like MX).</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Lookup requests are routed to the available DNS servers
    and LLMNR interfaces according to the following rules:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Lookups for the special hostname
      <literal>localhost</literal> are never routed to the
      network. (A few other, special domains are handled the same way.)</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Single-label names are routed to all local
      interfaces capable of IP multicasting, using the LLMNR
      protocol. Lookups for IPv4 addresses are only sent via LLMNR on
      IPv4, and lookups for IPv6 addresses are only sent via LLMNR on
      IPv6. Lookups for the locally configured host name and the
      <literal>_gateway</literal> host name are never routed to
      LLMNR.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Multi-label names are routed to all local
      interfaces that have a DNS server configured, plus the globally
      configured DNS server if there is one. Address lookups from the
      link-local address range are never routed to
      DNS.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If lookups are routed to multiple interfaces, the first
    successful response is returned (thus effectively merging the
    lookup zones on all matching interfaces). If the lookup failed on
    all interfaces, the last failing response is returned.</para>

    <para>Routing of lookups may be influenced by configuring
    per-interface domain names. See
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.network</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    for details. Lookups for a hostname ending in one of the
    per-interface domains are exclusively routed to the matching
    interfaces.</para>

    <para>See the <ulink url="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/resolved"> resolved D-Bus API
    Documentation</ulink> for information about the APIs <filename>systemd-resolved</filename> provides.</para>

    <para>Four modes of handling <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> (see
    <citerefentry project='man-pages'><refentrytitle>resolv.conf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>) are
    supported:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><command>systemd-resolved</command> maintains the
      <filename>/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf</filename> file for compatibility with traditional Linux
      programs. This file may be symlinked from <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>. This file lists the 127.0.0.53
      DNS stub (see above) as the only DNS server. It also contains a list of search domains that are in use by
      systemd-resolved. The list of search domains is always kept up-to-date. Note that
      <filename>/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf</filename> should not be used directly by applications, but only
      through a symlink from <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>. This file may be symlinked from
      <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> in order to connect all local clients that bypass local DNS APIs to
      <command>systemd-resolved</command> with correct search domains settings. This mode of operation is
      recommended.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>A static file <filename>/usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf</filename> is provided that lists
      the 127.0.0.53 DNS stub (see above) as only DNS server. This file may be symlinked from
      <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> in order to connect all local clients that bypass local DNS APIs to
      <command>systemd-resolved</command>. This file does not contain any search domains.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><command>systemd-resolved</command> maintains the
      <filename>/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf</filename> file for compatibility with traditional Linux
      programs. This file may be symlinked from <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> and is always kept up-to-date,
      containing information about all known DNS servers. Note the file format's limitations: it does not know a
      concept of per-interface DNS servers and hence only contains system-wide DNS server definitions. Note that
      <filename>/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf</filename> should not be used directly by applications, but only
      through a symlink from <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>. If this mode of operation is used local clients
      that bypass any local DNS API will also bypass <command>systemd-resolved</command> and will talk directly to the
      known DNS servers.</para> </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Alternatively, <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> may be managed by other packages, in which
      case <command>systemd-resolved</command> will read it for DNS configuration data. In this mode of operation
      <command>systemd-resolved</command> is consumer rather than provider of this configuration
      file. </para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Note that the selected mode of operation for this file is detected fully automatically, depending on whether
    <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> is a symlink to <filename>/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf</filename> or
    lists 127.0.0.53 as DNS server.</para>

        servers. Specifically any information about server feature support is flushed out, and the server feature
        probing logic is restarted on the next request, starting with the most fully featured level. Note that it
        should normally not be necessary to request this explicitly – except for debugging purposes – as
        <command>systemd-resolved</command> automatically forgets learnt information any time the DNS server
        configuration changes. Sending this signal to <command>systemd-resolved</command> is equivalent to the
