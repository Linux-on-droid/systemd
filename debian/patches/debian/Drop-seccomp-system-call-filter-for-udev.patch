Subject: Drop seccomp system call filter for udev

The seccomp based system call whitelist requires at least systemd 239 to
be the active init and during a dist-upgrade we can't guarantee that
systemd has been fully configured before udev is restarted.

This partially reverts upstream commit
ee8f26180d01e3ddd4e5f20b03b81e5e737657ae.

Once buster is released, this patch can be dropped.

Closes: #903224
