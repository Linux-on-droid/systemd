The systemd package contains very few and superficial patches, so bugs
about runtime functionality and feature requests should be opened directly
upstream at: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/new/choose

Issues about packaging and integration, maintainer scripts, enabling or
disabling existing features or dependencies, unit test or autopkgtest,
compilation, default configurations are all appropriate to be reported to
the distribution.
