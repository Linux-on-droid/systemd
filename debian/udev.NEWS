systemd (247-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  KERNEL API INCOMPATIBILITY: Linux 4.14 introduced two new uevents
  "bind" and "unbind" to the Linux device model. When this kernel
  change was made, systemd-udevd was only minimally updated to handle
  and propagate these new event types. The introduction of these new
  uevents (which are typically generated for USB devices and devices
  needing a firmware upload before being functional) resulted in a
  number of issues which we so far didn't address. We hoped the kernel
  maintainers would themselves address these issues in some form, but
  that did not happen. To handle them properly, many (if not most) udev
  rules files shipped in various packages need updating, and so do many
  programs that monitor or enumerate devices with libudev or sd-device,
  or otherwise process uevents. Please note that this incompatibility
  is not fault of systemd or udev, but caused by an incompatible kernel
  change that happened back in Linux 4.14, but is becoming more and
  more visible as the new uevents are generated by more kernel drivers.

  To learn more about the required udev rules changes please check the
  "CHANGES WITH 247" section of /usr/share/doc/systemd/NEWS.gz.

  DRM render nodes (/dev/dri/renderD*) are now owned by group "render"
  (previously group "video"). Dynamic ACLs via the "uaccess" udev tag are still
  applied, so in the common case things should just continue to work.
  If you rely on static permissions to access those devices, you need to update
  group memberships accordingly to use group "render" now.

systemd (220-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  The mechanism for providing stable network interface names changed.
  Previously they were kept in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
  which mapped device MAC addresses to the (arbitrary) name they got when
  they first appeared (i. e. mostly at the time of installation). As this
  had several problems and is not supported any more, this is deprecated in
  favor of the "net.ifnames" mechanism. With this most of your network
  interfaces will get location-based names. If you have ifupdown, firewall,
  or other configuration that relies on the old names, you need to update
  these by Debian 10/Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and then remove
  /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules. Please see
  /usr/share/doc/udev/README.Debian.gz for details about this.
